## This directory contains the code to create the correspondingly named figures in the `figures/` directory. 

All figures with the exception of Figures 2 and 3 have subdirectories containing the code and input files necessary to create a draft version of the figures. Figures 2 and 3 were created using Adobe Illustrator and Microsoft PowerPoint. Note that code-generated figures will not look identical to the figures in the final publication due to edits made to the aesthetics of the figures pre-publication. 

Please navigate into each Figure's subdirectory to view and run their corresponding scripts. 

**Note**: Some code scripts used to generate Figures in the `figures/main/` folder can also be used to generate figures in the `figures/supporting/` folder, unless stated the code script is explicitly listed in the `Fig_Supporting/` folder.
