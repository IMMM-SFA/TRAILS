## This directory contains the code to create the correspondingly named figures in the `figures/` directory. 

All figures with the exception of Figures 2 and 3 have subdirectories containing the code and input files necessary to create a draft version of the figures. Figures 2 and 3 were created using Adobe Illustrator and Microsoft PowerPoint. Note that code-generated figures will not look identical to the figures in the final publication due to edits made to the aesthetics of the figures pre-publication.
